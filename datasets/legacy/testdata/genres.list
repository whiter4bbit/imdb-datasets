4: The Genres
=============

	 The genres list exists for the sole purpose of increasing the
	 searchability of The Internet Movie Database.

	 Genres are the common categories in which we can classify movies,
	 there aren't that many of them.

	 The name and number of Genres are subject to change over time.

	 The Genres:

				Action          Adventure       Adult       Animation
		Comedy      Crime       Documentary Drama
		Fantasy     Family      Film-Noir   Horror
		Musical     Mystery     Romance     Sci-Fi
		Short       Thriller    War     Western

	 No white space is allowed.  ie "Film Noir" is wrong; its "Film-Noir"
	 They start with an uppercase letter.


5: Submission Rules
===================

	 How To Add Genres 
	 -----------------

	 Send email to   adds@imdb.com   with the subject "ADD".  Above the
	 data you write the word "GENRE" on a line by itself.  "GENRES" also works.

	 Under that you write the titles and genres like this:

			<title>|<genre>

	 When there are more genres for a movie, simply add them on
	 multiple lines under each other, like this:

			<title1>|<genre1>
			<title1>|<genre2>
			<title1>|<genre3>

	 When you do it that way, the most important genres should come on top,
	 and the least important genres on the bottom.  The order should
	 represent how valid the genres are.

	 Example:

			To: adds@imdb.com
			Subject: ADD

			GENRES
			Saving Private Ryan (1998)|Drama
			Saving Private Ryan (1998)|War
			Speed (1994)|Action
			Speed (1994)|Thriller
			END

	 Some examples on genres you shouldn't add:

				Incorrect genres                   Correct genres
				----------------                   --------------
				Science Fiction                    Sci-Fi

				Short Documentary                  Documentary
																				 + Short

				Action, Thriller                   Action
																				 + Thriller

				COMEDY                             Comedy

	 Also bear in mind that a movie is not necessarily a "Comedy" just
	 because there are a few quick remarks or funny jokes in it.  It happens
	 too often that movies are registered with incorrect genres.  It's not
	 a disaster, but it is annoying for the person renting "Schindler's List"
	 to watch a good "Horror" movie.

	 If a film contains moments, or aspects of a genre, do NOT put it 
	 as a main genre.  Instead put the "aspect" as a Keyword separately.
	 ie "Ghostbusters (1984)|horror".  Keywords is a separate list.

	 GUIDE TO CORRECT GENRES
	 -----------------------

	 Sometimes genres that don't fit a movie are added, and they should be
	 removed as soon as possible.

	 To remove a genre from a movie, just put a "!" in front of the line,
	 like this (to remove the genre "Horror" from "Schindlers' List":

			GENRES
			!Schindler's List (1993)|Horror
			END

	 If the genres in a movie are in a crazy order you can re-order them
	 by deleting them first and then adding them in the "correct" order.
