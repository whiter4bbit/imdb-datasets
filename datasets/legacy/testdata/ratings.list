TOP 250 MOVIES (25000+ VOTES)

The formula used to calculate the top 250 movies is:

  weighted rank = (v/(v+k))*X + (k/(v+k))*C

  where:

    X = average for the movie (mean)
    v = number of votes for the movie
    k = minimum votes required to be listed in the top 250 (currently 25000)
    C = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.90)

note: for this top 250, only votes from regular voters are considered.

REPORT FORMAT
=============

     In this list, movies have been rated on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being
good and 1 being bad.  For each movie, the total number of votes, the
average rating, and the vote distribution are shown.  New movies are indicated
by a "*" before their entry.

     The vote distribution uses a single character to represent the percentage
of votes for each ranking.  The following characters codes can appear:

     "." no votes cast        "3" 30-39% of the votes  "7" 70-79% of the votes
     "0"  1-9%  of the votes  "4" 40-49% of the votes  "8" 80-89% of the votes
     "1" 10-19% of the votes  "5" 50-59% of the votes  "9" 90-99% of the votes
     "2" 20-29% of the votes  "6" 60-69% of the votes  "*" 100%   of the votes


HOW TO VOTE
===========

     To have your votes tallied in the list, send mail to
vote@imdb.com.  In your mail, any line beginning with the word
"vote" will be considered as a vote.  All other lines ARE IGNORED.  No human
will see your mail.  Votes must be of the form

        vote <rating> <title>

where <rating> is an integer between 1 and 10, and <title> is everything on the
line after the <rating>.  Case is not considered in movie titles.  Valid votes
might be

        vote 8 Annie Hall (1977)
        vote 1 santa claus conquers the martians (1964)

To make things easy, the reply-to field of this posting is set to the
vote tabulator.  Simply hit "r" to send in your votes.

The movie mail-server can now provide a number of ballots to help you get
started in voting. For more details send an e-mail message with the subject:

   HELP BALOT

to <mail-server@imdb.com> (NOTE: this address is different from the vote
tabulator address). There are currently three ballots available via the
server: the currently weekly ballot as posted to rec.arts.movies.lists+surveys
(use subject "BALOT WEEKLY"), one containing all the movies with 100+ votes
(use subject "BALOT POPULAR"), and one based on the must-see movies list posted
to the group earlier this year (use subject "BALOT MUST-SEE"). Finally note
the commands all use the word BALOT rather than BALLOT owing to a limitation
in the mail-server software.
