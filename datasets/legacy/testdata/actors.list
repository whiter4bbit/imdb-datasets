SUBMITTING UPDATES
==================

We rely on users of the database to submit corrections and additions to keep
the list as accurate and complete as possible. The most convenient method
of submitting them is via the movie mail-server's central collection service.
For a comprehensive guide send an e-mail message with the subject:

  HELP ADD FULL

to <mail-server@imdb.com>.

The instructions specific to the actors list are given below.


KEYWORD INTERFACE
=================

This is the most flexible interface but can appear quite complex if you aren't
familiar with the organization of the database.

Additions
---------

(1) mark the start of the data with the word:

	ACTOR

(2) for each addition, include on a separate line an entry of the form:

	 <name>|<title>|<attributes>|<character name>|<order>

	where:

	 <name> is the actors name in <surname>, <firstname> order. Please note
			the space after the comma as in: "Grant, Cary".

	 <title> is the title of the movie or TV-series in which the actor
			 appeared, please include the year of release as part of the title
			 (see examples below).

	 <attributes> records any award nominations or wins and in most cases will
				  be empty. Example attributes include:

	   (AA)           = academy award winner (best actor)
	   (AAN)          = academy award nominee (best actor)
	   (S:AA)         = academy award winner (best supporting actor)
	   (S:AAN)        = academy award nominee (best supporting actor)
	   (GG)           = golden globe winner (best drama actor)
	   (GGN)          = golden globe nominee (best drama actor)

	 <character name>  is the character name of the actor.

	 <order> is a number to record the position in which the actor appears in
			 the credits (1=star billing)

	The full additions guide contains more information on the formats.

	Notes:

	 - Apart from the <name> and <title> all these fields are optional, but
	   please leave the "|" separator for any blank fields, otherwise the some
	   of the data may be lost.

	 - Guest appearances in TV-series are NOT eligible for the main actors and
	   actresses list. The person must have played a recurring role across a
	   number of episodes in order to be included. See the section describing
	   the biography database for an alternative method of adding this type of
	   information.

	 - Please only credit individual names. For example, if all the members of
	   a particular rock group appeared in a movie then include them under
	   their individual names and not the name of the whole group.

	 - The actors and actresses sections are for people only. No animals.

	Examples:

	ACTOR
	Grant, Cary|North by Northwest (1959)||Rogert Thornhill|1
	Grant, Cary|Awful Truth, The (1937)|||1
	Grant, Cary|Philadelphia Story, The (1940)|||
	Hopkins, Anthony|Silence of the Lambs, The (1990)|(AA)||

(3) If the additions include a title that is new to the database, please also
	include a section of the form:

	TITLE
	<title>|<year>|

	Example:

	TITLE
	North by Northwest (1959)|1959|
	Silence of the Lambs, The (1960)|1990|

(4) Mark the end of your data with the word

	END

	on a separate line.

(5) Mail the data to <add@imdb.com>. The mail-server will mail a receipt back
	to you and place the data in the queue for processing by the list managers
	in the next update.


Character Name Additions
------------------------

If you wish to add character names to *existing* entries in the database only,
use the keyword:

  CHARA

and the format:

  <name>|<title>|<character name>


Cast Ordering Additions
-----------------------

If you wish to add cast ordering information to *existing* entries in the
database only, use the keyword:

  ORDER

and the format:

  <name>|<title>|<order>


Deletions
---------

To delete an incorrect entry on the list, the format is similar to those
described above, but a '!' character is placed at the start of each entry. The
format is:

ACTOR
!<name>|<title>|

For example:

ACTOR
!Grant, Cary|Notorious (1992) (TV)|


Corrections
-----------

(1) Correcting a name across the whole database

	If you spot a spelling error in a name in the database, use the keyword

	  NAMECORRECT

	and the format:

	  <current name>|<correct name>

	For example:

	  NAMECORRECT
	  Bogart, Humphry|Bogart, Humphrey|

(2) Replacing an individual entry

	Replacements can be made by deleting the incorrect entry and adding the
	correct version. For example:

	  ACTOR
	  !Grant, Cary|Notorious (1992) (TV)|
	  Grant, Cary|Notorious (1946)|||

(3) Other corrections

	Finally, if your correction cannot be expressed in the forms above, use
	the keyword:

	  CORRECT

	and then include a description of your correction in a free text over as
	many lines as you need.
